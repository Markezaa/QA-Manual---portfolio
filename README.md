The goal of this branch is to showcase my ability to design structured, clear,
and reusable test cases for various types of functionality.

Structure:
Each test case includes the following elements:

-Test Case ID
-Title / Name
-Preconditions
-Test Steps
-Expected Results
-Actual Results (optional for executed cases)
-Severity / Priority

Notes:
All test cases in this branch were created for educational purposes and portfolio demonstration.
They are not related to a specific real-world application but follow practical test case writing practices.
