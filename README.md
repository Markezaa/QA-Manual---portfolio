2BVA Decision Tables Branch:

This branch contains examples of 2BVA (two-value decision tables) created as part of my manual QA training and practice.
These tables are designed to simulate logic-based test case generation using structured decision-making techniques.

Purpose:
The goal of this branch is to demonstrate the ability to analyze input combinations and expected outcomes using two-value decision tables.
This technique is commonly used in test design to ensure comprehensive coverage of business rules and logical conditions.

Structure:
Each document in this branch includes:

-Input conditions and possible values 
-Expected outputs for each combination
-Unique test cases derived from the table
-Brief description of the scenario being modeled

Notes:
These examples were created for learning and portfolio purposes.
They are not based on real application, but are intended to show understanding of structured test design using decision tables.
