This branch contains test plans created as part of my practical training and personal development in software quality assurance.
The documents are written to simulate real-world QA documentation and follow standard test planning structures.

Purpose:
The goal of this branch is to demonstrate the ability to design clear, structured, and comprehensive test plans for various functionalities and scenarios.
These documents reflect typical QA planning used in manual and functional testing environments.

Structure:
-Each file represents a test plan for a specific feature, module, or system flow.
-The documents include key components such as:
-Test objectives and scope
-Types of testing (e.g. functional, regression)
-Test environment setup
-Entry and exit criteria
-Roles and responsibilities
-Test schedule and deliverables

Notes:
These documents were created for educational and portfolio purposes. 
They are not based on real projects, but aim to follow best practices in test documentation.
