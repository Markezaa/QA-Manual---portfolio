This branch contains documented suggestions for improving user experience (UX),
accessibility, and usability across various websites and digital products. Each improvement is based on direct usage,
testing, or observational analysis, and includes a clear breakdown of the issue, proposed solution, and reasoning.

Contents:
-Usability feedback on real websites 
-Accessibility and navigation recommendations 
-Clear "Current → Request → Reason" structure for each improvement 
-Screenshots and visual references where applicable.

Purpose:
The goal of this branch is to showcase my ability to identify and document areas for improvement in user-facing interfaces.
This includes UX heuristics, clarity of information, interaction design, and overall product usability.

Structure: 
Each improvement follows this format:
-Current
–What the issue is and where it appears
-Request
–Specific proposed change or addition 
-Reason
–Why this change improves the experience

Note:
All suggestions are made for learning and demonstration purposes, based on public-facing websites. 
This branch is part of my effort to grow as a QA specialist.
